# Welcome stranger!
Hi! This is a REST API made to control **Xiaomi Yeelight** smart devices. 
Written in Node.JS with Express.


## Configuration
In order to be able to use the API you need to enable **LAN Control** in the Yeelight application.
You will also need **npm** and **Node.JS** installed.

## Installation
Clone the repository then run `npm i`

## Running
Navigate to the root folder of the API and run `npm run start`


## Routes
Coming soon...

## Special thanks to:
